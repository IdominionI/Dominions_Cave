<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">In
an attempt to understand the physical universe, the universal
practice of science has evolved to create theories backed up with
evidence to explain the phenomenon and processes that are observed to
occur in the natural world. Without going into the history or detail,
two grand theories exist that dominate and are used to explain the
micro and macro phenomenon of matter interaction and transformation.
These two theories being the standard model to explain the physics on
the atomic and nuclear level where electromagnetism and nuclear
forces dominate, and general relativity where gravity on the large
level of distances dominates. Both being separated and not able to be
reconciled into one theory that has frustrated scientists since
Albert Einstein first attempted the idea.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Given
the basis of both theories, this can be explained by the fact that
the approach each has at its core of theory being quite different. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
standard model has as its basis that matter is made of one type of
point like particles (Fermions) that have the observed forces of
interaction of matter being carried by a second carrier particle of
matter (Bosons). These Boson force carrying particles are said to
interact in such a manner as to be absorbed or emitted by the Fermion
particles, transferring energy and creating the observed phenomenon
of matter interaction. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">In
the standard model, particles are also thought of not of as particles
that have a defined surface or structure, but are in effect a
condensate of a field, and a field that can be considered as a form
of energy. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The Fermions
exist in one type of field </span><span style="font-weight: normal">for
each fermion particle, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">and
the Bosons are a </span><span style="font-weight: normal">force
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">carrier particle that
facilitates the interaction of Fermions with each other.</span></font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">General
relativity has the postulate that matter has a mass charge that bends
the space </span><span style="font-weight: normal">and time </span><span style="font-weight: normal">around
it,  and that this bending of space</span><span style="font-weight: normal">time
</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> projects back onto the
matter to direct its motion. The bending of space also has an effect
of compressing or stretching space such that the measurement of time
changes dependent upon the reference frame that matter exists within.
 The mass then follows a path governed by this spacetime geometry,
which in a feedback loop, the mass changes the  spacetime geometry </span><span style="font-weight: normal">in</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
such </span><span style="font-weight: normal">a way</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
that the path trajectory of a mass may change. It is this bending of
spacetime that is what makes up what is observed as gravity, and
gravity thus is not really a force.</span></font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">And
thus there seems to be from the outset, an incompatibility between
these two theories, but also a commonality. The incompatibility being
that the standard model relies on force carrying particles to
transmit forces, and general relativity on the bending of </span><span style="font-weight: normal">the
geometry of </span><span style="font-weight: normal">space and time
to act as a perception of a force in creating a </span><span style="font-weight: normal">geometric
like </span><span style="font-weight: normal"> path for matter and
energy to follow and flow on. The commonality being that both have
the idea and postulate of a field </span><span style="font-weight: normal">or
fields </span><span style="font-weight: normal">that </span><span style="font-weight: normal">dictate
or construct the formation of matter, and is the means by which the
interactions of matter and energy is governed </span><span style="font-weight: normal">by.

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Both
theories also have a commonality of utilising the principle of least
action and Noetherâ€™s theorem.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">The
principle of least action is a postulate that any natural phenomenon
of causality will follow the path or process of least or minimal time
or energy to progress from one physical state to another. Such a
process is expressed in mathematical terms of using what is known as
modified versions of Newtonian mechanics. These mathematical models
of physical processes are the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
representations of Newtonian mechanics in terms of </span><span style="font-weight: normal">the
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">total </span><span style="font-weight: normal">energy
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">of a physical state or
system, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">where that total
energy is in terms of kinetic and potential energy.</span></font></font></p>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Quantum
physics has a complex and long Lagrangian field equation to model the
quantum world, and general relativity the famous Einstein equation to
model a similar Lagrangian looking energy field equation as a basis
of it tensor of mass energy.</font></font></p>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Since
Einstein, Physicists have also concluded with Einstein that all the
physical forces and theories of the quantum and relativity realm
should be able to be unified into one grand unification theory, or a
grand unified field theory. The fundamental problem is that the
standard model requires that to create a quantum theory of gravity to
be included in the standard model, there needs to be a hypothetical
particle called a graviton to act as intermediary between the
gravitational field and all of matter and energy. It is found that by
including a graviton, infinities jump out of the calculations and
derivations, creating a dilemma and frustration that gravity and the
standard model are incompatible with one another. General relativity
has, it seems, no ability to integrate with a quantum field theory on
which the standard model is based upon, as it is, by and large, a
geometric model of gravity and time.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">This
is the difficulty that physicists face as a last great hurdle in
understanding of how the universe is constructed and how all things
fit together. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Current
attempts to overcome the incompatibility of quantum field theory and
general relativity from being united range from grand ideas and
mathematical attempts such as string theory and modified general
relativity theories  which have had some limited successes,
outweighed by greater problems or contradictions. A phenomenon of a
perception of dark  matter and dark energy that are used to explain
the observed rotation of stars within galaxies and a measured
acceleration of galaxies away from each other as one looks further in
distance complicate the theory of both general relativity and the
standard model even further on their own merits, let alone into being
unified into one unified field theory.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">But
despite the difficulty and seemingly incompatibility of unifying the
standard model with general relativity, both theories on their own
merit are observed to be highly accurate in prediction of physical
phenomenon and used for much of modern technology from computers to
GPS services.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">What
all this means is that despite great accuracy and agreement of
observed results the standard and general relativity models of are
lacking in that they cannot explain some observed or measured
physical properties or phenomenon that exist, let alone be united
into one grand unified theory. For example, the standard model has no
means to explain the measured masses of many of its particles. Both
theories cannot fully explain what are called dark matter and dark
energy. Any  grand unified theory would also need to be able to model
these new physical observations, let alone to predict something as
fundamental as the mass of a particle.</font></font></p>

how can the human mind come to reconcile and bring together the two
giants of physical theories that dominate the current thought and
understanding of a model for the workings of the universe?</font></font></p>
<h3 class="western" align="center">A New Way Of Thinking</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">How
can the human mind come to reconcile and bring together the two
giants of physical theories that dominate the current thought and
understanding of a model for the workings of the universe as outlined

<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">One
way is to try and start afresh, try and use the discovered theories
of the standard model and general relativity as a guide rather than
as dogma or as the ultimate codex by which to form ones thinking or
opinion upon. One needs to be reminded that these theories are but
only mathematical models by which one uses to form predictions of
physical phenomenon upon. The mathematics used and any approximations
that are made to simplify the mathematics can leave out certain
details can create a kind of butterfly effect. An effect that will
render results that then need further mathematical work where
corrections are introduced to match observed measurements that render
the understanding of the underlying physics to be obscured, and even
misdirected into a false understanding of the real physical
processes. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">It
may be that the mathematical model created, though predicting the
results accurately, is flawed or even totally incorrect in it
explaining the physics involved. The example of the Ptolemaic model
of the planets in the ancient world was accurate in predicting the
motion of the planets, and even eclipses, but was fundamentally and
completely wrong in understanding the true nature of a sun centred
planetary system. The same kind of mathematical modelling and
thinking may be present in both of the standard model and general
relativity. In the Ptolemaic model, it was assumed that the Earth was
the centre of the universe, in the standard model and general
relativity, it may be that some fundamental axiom, postulate or
assumption is also just as wrong, and needs to be discovered and
corrected.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">In
trying to understand and model the universe, the tool being used that
is mathematics that is the driver of understanding may also be part
of the problem. One or more fundamental assumptions of mathematics,
though working in the realm of pure mathematics and has a
mathematical proof of being true and is valid in the human world, is
inappropriate and false for modelling the real physical world  It may
also be that the mathematics of the physical world is incorrectly
modelled in the mathematics being used, especially in the quantum
realm. Mathematical tools such as integration and statistics may just
not work at a certain level where mathematical continuity and
infinitely small subdivisions of certain properties are not present.
Many complex mathematical techniques may have no real physical
meaning, other than creating a new representation of a mathematical
equation to simplify the calculations of complex systems. In this
simplification, the physics and understanding of basic underlying
fundamental physical processes that one is trying to understand is
lost in the mathematics, and as such, a potential cascade of being
misdirected into the wrong model of the physical world is created.</font></font></p>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">It
may be that one needs to go back to all of the fundamental
definitions, assumptions and postulates of physics, examine them with
a modern eye, and with hindsight of the last hundred plus years of
discovery and observation, and where appropriate, modify or redefine
them to fit into a more comprehensive and relevant language of
understanding.</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">One
new form of understanding and thinking may be that a model of the
universe is better to be constructed as a kind of iterative process
of events where all physical processes that govern the universe
occur, are not governed by equations that need a space and time of
mathematical continuity , but by a process of iterative steps that
are so small in magnitude that to the human mind are perceived to be
continuous. This is most generalised by use of the human minds
creation of mathematical modelling that require as a basis an
infinitely divisible or large spacial coordinate system that in the
everyday world of human perception can be used to model the world. It
is only when the modelling of the universe outside this perception of
the very small and very large that those mathematical models fail,
and thus also an understanding of the how the true nature of the
fundamental workings of the universe break down.</font></font></p>
