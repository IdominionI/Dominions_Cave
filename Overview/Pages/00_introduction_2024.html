Understanding the Universe</h1>
<h3 class="western" align="center">Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Within
this document is an attempt to give an alternative approach of
thinking and process of investigation to studying the universe so as
to gain a more possible truth of understanding and knowledge of the
inner workings and structure of the physical universe that the human
mind observes and exists within. What is not attempted is to propose
a replacement of current theory, but to express that the current
thought process and accepted conventions of physics and mathematical
tools and theories used to create the models of the universe may need
revision and consideration of a different approach that can lead to a
more clearer understanding of the universe that then can be used to
modify and enhance an understanding of the universe.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">By
taking a different look and attempting to build from the ground up
with different definitions of the fundamentals of the observed
phenomenon of the physical universe that does not conflict with
theory, a different perspective of what constitutes the fundamental
make up and processes of the physical universe can be derived,
leading to a greater approach to understanding and comprehension of
what is observed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
document first tackles the most fundamental concepts of the universe
that cannot be expressed in mathematical form to be understood, but
need to taken from a different angle so as to form the basis of
approach from a more holistic and qualitative definition that can be
applied universally. It could be considered that there is a kind of
philosophical approach being applied.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Such
fundamental concepts that forms the basis of all of physics such as
space, time and energy are tackled first to be given what may be
different definitions, interpretations and explanations as to what
they are and how they fit in with the universe. These will not break
with current physics, but to offer an alternative perspective of what
they may be.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">As
this document progresses, other interpretations and explanations of
physical phenomenon will be presented with arguments that may involve
some mathematical treatment to help explain such an argument. But as
has been discovered, many a consideration has already been presented
in the past that correlates with what is proposed in this document by
past minds that have put forward the same arguments with greater
detail, treatment and explanation. It is comforting to find that when
one comes up with what one considers as an original thought, or
approach of thinking, to then find out that others have already
considered such, to then know if one is on the right or wrong track. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
it can be forgiven if there are such arguments that have been
proposed here that have already been documented and better presented,
but not known by the author.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">What
is important is to consider that the current understanding of the
universe as proposed and modelled by physicists can be flawed by a
following bias of conventional thought. This is not uncommon in
history. Many a greater understanding and modelling of the physical
universe, and other scientific disciplines have been thawted by
conventional authorities chained down by not accepting new or
different trains of thinking. This has either been because of
personal traits related to ego, reputation, status and belief
systems, or by institutions unable to accept alternative positions
for the same and other reasons. But this is not all together a bad
thing. To change the thought processes and acceptance of new theories
of understanding require strong arguments with evidence to back them
up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
document is not an attempt to change or challenge such current
conventions or authorities of physics, just to offer a different
approach to thinking to gain a greater understanding of the universe
and its workings. The author hopes this document will be helpful in
that respect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
is a work in progress and is a draft that may change as new drafts
and discoveries. Some mistakes may be found and will later be
corrected as with this introduction. </font>

document is divided into sections or parts and have a format similar
to that of a textbook. All major text sections at this stage are
presented as pdf documents to be viewed in a browser pdf viewer, and
thus can be easily viewed separately and printed out.</font></p>
