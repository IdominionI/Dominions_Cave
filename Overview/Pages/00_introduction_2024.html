Aether model of the Universe</h1>
<h3 class="western" align="center">Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
is an outline and detailed investigation of creating a model of a
universe that has space defined as an entity that is an aether. This
is a project that has a purpose to document an attempt to create a
hypothetical alternative model of a universe so as to gain a possible
greater understanding and knowledge of the real universe that humans
exist within and observe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Therefore
this aether model will have as a basis of it, the physics of the real
universe, but with some alternative interpretations or lines of
thought of the physics that is observed, and theories derived from.
It has been discovered that many of these alternative proposals of
approach to the accepted conventional thinking and methods of
approach to understand and gain knowledge of the physics of the
universe have previously been argued and discussed, or are at present
being proposed. So this document will not repeat these proposals in
detail. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">No
proposal of a replacement of current theory is made, but it is to
express that the current thought process and accepted conventions of
physics and mathematical tools and theories used to create the models
of the universe may need revision and consideration of a different
approach that can lead to a more clearer understanding of the
universe.  This then can be used to modify and enhance an
understanding of the universe.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Much
of modern physics to model and explain the universe seems to be very
abstract and mathematical. So much so, that it could be stated that
too much of modern physics that it is more like a mathematical theory
than a physical description of the universe,</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
document tackles the most fundamental concepts of the universe that
cannot be expressed in mathematical form to be understood, but need
to taken from a different angle so as to form the basis of approach
from a more holistic and qualitative definition that can be applied
universally. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">By
taking a different look and attempting to build from the ground up
with different definitions of the fundamentals of the observed
phenomenon of the physical universe, a different perspective of what
constitutes the fundamental make up and processes of the physical
universe can be derived, leading to a greater approach to
understanding and comprehension of what is observed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Such
fundamental concepts that forms the basis of all of physics such as
space, time and energy are tackled to give what may be different
definitions, interpretations and explanations as to what they are and
how they fit in with the universe. These will not break with current
physics, but to offer an alternative perspective of what they may be.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Other
interpretations and explanations of physical phenomenon will be
presented with arguments that may involve some mathematical treatment
to help explain such an argument. But as has been discovered, many a
consideration has already been presented in the past that correlates
with what is proposed in this document by past and present minds that
have put forward the same arguments with greater detail, treatment
and explanation. It is comforting to find that when one comes up with
what one considers as an original thought, or approach of thinking,
to then find out that others have also come up with the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">So
it can be forgiven if there are such arguments that have been
proposed here that have already been documented and better presented,
but not known by the author.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">What
is important is to consider that the current understanding of the
universe as proposed and modelled by physicists can be flawed by a
following bias of conventional thought. This is not uncommon in
history. Many a greater understanding and modelling of the physical
universe, and other scientific disciplines have been thawted by
conventional authorities chained down by not accepting new or
different trains of thinking. This has either been because of
personal traits related to ego, reputation, status and belief
systems, or by institutions unable to accept alternative positions
for the same and other reasons. But this is not all together a bad
thing. To change the thought processes and acceptance of new theories
of understanding require strong arguments with evidence to back them
up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0.1cm"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">This
document is not an attempt to change or challenge such current
conventions or authorities of physics, just to offer a different
approach to thinking to gain a greater understanding of the universe
and its workings. The author hopes this document will be helpful in
that respect. It is also a document of personal endeavour so as to
record personal trains of thought so as to act as a kind of notebook
for future reference and not to forget or repeat ones thoughts. As
such the documentation may have poor structure or large dialogue of
thoughts in an attempt to explain certain physical concepts or
processes etc. The Strange aspect of this is that as further
investigations proceed, many of these personal thoughts or aspects of
the workings of the universe are discovered to be part of past or
current physics, but with certain differences in perspective, which
is what this document is all about.</font></p>
