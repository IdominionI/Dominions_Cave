<p align="center"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>FUNDAMENTALS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The most
fundamental of all understanding that is required to understand the
physical universe are the kind of ethereal concepts that the human
mind can experience and define, but not directly touch through any
real physical sense by observing something that can be called an
entity. </font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The most
fundamental concepts that form the basis of all the models and
thought of of the physical world are space, time, and energy. Things
that are observed, but have no entity that can be thought of as the
source of. </font>

each of these concepts that may differ from current conventional

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>MATHEMATICS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Mathematics is a
fundamental tool that is used to model the physics of the universe by
creating theories of mathematical relationships between certain
physical characteristics of matter that is based upon observation and
measurement. These mathematical relationships are then used to build
mathematical models of physical behaviour which are then used to
predict results or phenomena that can be tested to see if the theory
holds out. When test results equate with predictions, then the
theory, or at least the mathematics of that theory is said to be
correct.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Despite all the
successes of using mathematics to explain and predict, mathematics
may have some limits and misconceptions of its use in modelling the
universe, or indeed if some of the mathematics used have certain
flaws that may work in one situation, are limited or invalid in
others. In the following documentation, such an argument is made.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>PHYSICAL
CONSTANTS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In all of the
theories of physics based upon experiment and observation of results,
relationships between certain physical properties or traits are
quantities of proportionality. To get one physical property to equate
with another such as forces in the theory of gravity or
electromagnetism equating to a measured charge of a field, one or
more constant of proportionality is introduced. It is proposed that
these constants have a large bearing and influence on the true nature
of understanding that needs to be achieved to understand the universe
and its workings. The relationships of electromagnetism and Newtonian
gravity have a very similar resemblance to each other in structure.
This ,may also suggest a relationship between the constants G for
gravity and permittivity, ϵ<sub>0</sub> for electric fields and
permeability μ<sub>0</sub> for magnetic fields. Indeed such a
relation ship is given with the speed of light being that possible
connection. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Other constants
used in physics may have no real physical meaning at all as they may
be a derivation of the mathematics that a model needed to fit in with
observation, and is thus limited to only ideal circumstances. Thus
when finding and using constants in physics, one needs to be aware of
the context and validity of use of such a constant, and if it is
universal such as the speed of light, or just a calculation tool as
in the ideal gas equation PV=nRT.</font></p>
