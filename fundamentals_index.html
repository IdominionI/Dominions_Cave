the Fundamentals</b></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">To begin to create
an aether model the universe, one needs to have a basis of
fundamental principles and concepts that form the foundation as a
basis which to build upon.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The most
fundamental of all understanding that is required to understand the
physical universe are the kind of ethereal concepts that the human
mind can experience and define, but not directly touch through any
real physical sense by observation of the physical surroundings and
the objects or entities that exist. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The most
fundamental concepts that form the basis of all the models and
thought of of the physical world are space, time, and energy. Things
that are observed, but have no entity that can be thought of as the
source of those concepts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Presented here in
the following sections, are a proposal and explanation of each of
these concepts that form a basis for a model of the physical
universe. Most notably being the concepts of space, time and energy.
They may differ from current conventional thinking in some ways, but
do add clarity and definition to what may be considered as nebulous
and unable to be defined.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In a brief summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Time is the
progression of a physical entity, or system of entities transitioning
from one physical state A to another physical state B, and that this
transition has a consistent and discrete period of delay to do so
with differing rates of transitioning between different physical
states of transition of the same or different entities.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Energy is the
physical substrate by means of interaction or process that causes an
entity, or system of entities to change from one physical state A to
another physical state B. On the most fundamental level, it are the
progenitor causes of the forces of electromagnetism and gravity that
are defined as energy. That is electromagnetic and gravitational
fields.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Since time and
energy have as their basis of definition a physical transition of an
an entity from one physical state A to another physical state B, time
and energy should thus have a relationship to each other.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Space is the domain
upon which all physical entities exist within, in which all physical
phenomena and behaviour of processes reside. The observable universe
in the human mind has three degrees of freedom, and thus is
interpreted as being of three dimensions. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If Space can be
considered as being a product of, or that the entities and phenomena
that exist within space are a part of space and can modify, or be
modified by space in any interaction such that space can be
considered as an entity of the universe in its own right, then a
relationship should exist between space, time and energy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Because of the
limitations of knowledge of the physical state of entities and the
universe, and the more unpredictable nature of the elements of the
universe, just as with predicting weather systems as an analogy
beyond a certain time frame, so it is with predicting the outcomes of
non isolated physical entities and systems. It cannot be known beyond
a certain confidence of predictability and probability on a given
time frame what the future circumstances will be for predicting the
behaviour of one, or more entities in a system of entities. Such
predictions cannot be expressed as mathematical equations alone, as
the processes involved are of a progressive iterative nature. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Many physics
equations give relationships between the physical properties of
entities, but not the statistical and accumulative effects of all
these relationships on the processes that change the physical state
of one or more entities that are observed as physical behaviour or
phenomena. Changes to the physical state of an entity at an instance
in time is determined by the physical state of its local space in
which it exists at that instant of its local time, not by the
physical properties of an entity at a location beyond this local zone
of space, as the properties of entities interacting and changing the
physical properties of space have not yet been “received” of
translated as a change of physical state of the local space in which
the entity exists within so as to interact with.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Such changes of the
physical space in which an entity interacts with are referred to as
changes in the physical state of a field that exists and extends into
all of space, and which by experiment have a source or interaction
with entities having observed and measured physical properties of
electric charge and/or mass. Interactions cause change of physical
state that gives rise to motion, which then in turn changes the
physical state of space, which in turn causes and interaction of
entities with this change of physical space, and so on in a feedback
loop of an iterative nature.</font></p>

<p align="center" style="page-break-before: always"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>MATHEMATICS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Mathematics is a
fundamental tool that is used to model the physics of the universe by
creating theories of mathematical relationships between certain
physical characteristics of matter that is based upon observation and
measurement. These mathematical relationships are then used to build
mathematical models of physical behaviour which are then used to
predict results or phenomena that can be tested to see if the theory
holds out. When test results equate with predictions, then the
theory, or at least the mathematics of that theory is said to be
correct.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Despite all the
successes of using mathematics to explain and predict, mathematics
may have some limits and misconceptions of its use in modelling the
universe, or indeed if some of the mathematics used have certain
flaws that may work in one situation, are limited or invalid in
others. In the following documentation, such an argument is made.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="center" style="page-break-before: always"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><b>PHYSICAL
CONSTANTS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In all of the
theories of physics based upon experiment and observation of results,
relationships between certain physical properties or traits are
quantities of proportionality. To get one physical property to equate
with another such as forces in the theory of gravity or
electromagnetism equating to a measured charge of a field, one or
more constant of proportionality is introduced. It is proposed that
these constants have a large bearing and influence on the true nature
of understanding that needs to be achieved to understand the universe
and its workings. The relationships of electromagnetism and Newtonian
gravity have a very similar resemblance to each other in structure.
This ,may also suggest a relationship between the constants G for
gravity and permittivity, ϵ<sub>0</sub> for electric fields and
permeability μ<sub>0</sub> for magnetic fields. Indeed such a
relation ship is given with the speed of light being that possible
connection. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Other constants
used in physics may have no real physical meaning at all as they may
be a derivation of the mathematics that a model needed to fit in with
observation, and is thus limited to only ideal circumstances. Thus
when finding and using constants in physics, one needs to be aware of
the context and validity of use of such a constant, and if it is
universal such as the speed of light, or just a calculation tool as
in the ideal gas equation PV=nRT.</font></p>
